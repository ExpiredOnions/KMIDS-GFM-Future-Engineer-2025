 * @brief Extract line segments from timed LiDAR data by converting points to Cartesian coordinates,

 * The function performs the following steps:
 * 1. Filters out points with invalid distances or outside certain angular/distance ranges.
 * 2. Converts the remaining polar coordinates (angle, distance) to Cartesian coordinates in meters.
 * 3. Splits the points into candidate line segments using `splitSegment`, where a segment is split if any point
 *    deviates from the best-fit line by more than `splitThreshold`.
 * 4. Merges segments that are approximately collinear and close together using `mergeSegments`.
 *
 * @param timedLidarData LiDAR scan data with timestamps.
 * @param splitThreshold Maximum perpendicular distance (meters) from a point to the best-fit line before splitting the segment.
 * @param minPoints Minimum number of points required to form a segment.
 * @param maxPointGap Maximum allowed distance between consecutive points within a segment.
 * @param minLength Minimum length of a segment to keep after splitting.
 * @param mergeAngleThreshold Maximum angle difference (degrees) between segments to merge them.
