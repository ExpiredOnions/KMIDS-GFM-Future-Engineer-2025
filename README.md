## 1. About the Project

This project focuses on designing, building, and programming an autonomous robot capable of completing a series of complex obstacle challenges as part of the WRO Future Engineers competition.

Team KMIDS-GFM was inspired by the challenge of applying engineering principles and problem-solving skills to creatively and efficiently solve complex problems. Pushing forward with our passion for innovation and hands-on learning.

Our goal is to design and build a reliable and efficient system that demonstrates our technical and collaborative skills while serving as a learning experience. We followed a systematic process, including brainstorming, researching, prototyping, testing, and iterating. We maintained detailed documentation for ease of knowledge sharing and a smoother workflow throughout the project.

Our robot is engineered using a custom modular chassis in a rear-wheel drive configuration, controlled using a Raspberry Pi 5 and a Raspberry Pi Pico 2. It utilises a combination of an LIDAR sensor and a fish-eye lens camera to provide an advanced system for obstacle detection and navigation.

Our objective is to create an intelligent robot that is capable of navigating through obstacles with pinpoint precision and speed.

## 2. Mobility Management

- **Drive System:** 2-wheel differential drive (rear wheels).
- **Steering:** Front-wheel steering using S0004m servo.

### 2.1 Drive System

**Reason for Selection:**

- It is compact and lightweight, allowing us to fit it into our robot easily.
- Provides moderate torque that is more than enough for the flat arena.
- Easy to use on the robot and integrate with other parts.

The N20 motor is equipped with an encoder to provide precise motion feedback, ensuring the robot’s movements are accurate. The motor drives the rear wheels through a LEGO differential gear system, which allows the robot to maintain smooth and balanced turns even at higher speeds. By distributing torque between the two wheels, the differential minimises wheel slip and ensures stability during sharp manoeuvres.
The integration of encoders with the N20 motors provides real-time feedback for closed-loop control, enabling precise speed regulation and consistent lap performance. Although the torque of the N20 is modest, the combination with the differential gear makes it well-suited for the flat and predictable competition arena, striking a balance between efficiency, stability, and mechanical simplicity.

**Mounting:**

- Installed using 3D-printed motor clamps screwed to a detachable motor plate that is placed above the differential gear compartment. This will allow for future changes to accommodate bigger motors and gears. (./FreeCAD-Files/Assembly/mesh_export/MotorPlate_1x.stl)
  <img src="docs/resources/diffgear.jpg" alt="diff gear" width=300>
- Wires connected to Raspberry Pi Pico 2.
- Rubber wheels are screwed onto the motor shaft.

**Considerations:**
To reach a faster speed, we can upgrade the N20 motor to the N30, which is the easiest upgrade, providing an overall improvement in speed and torque. However, the N30 motor is typically larger and such, might need extra modifications to the robot's chassis and motor clamp to fit properly. It also generally operates at higher voltages and currents, so the power supply needs to be modified to support this upgrade.

### 2.2 Steering

We considered many steering systems, but following our design principle of precision, we decided to implement Ackermann steering geometry to better replicate the precise turning behaviour of real-world vehicles. Unlike simpler systems, Ackermann steering has the advantage of smoother turns by moving each wheel at different angles in a turn, reducing the slippage of the tires and improving turn accuracy.

The fundamental principle of Ackermann geometry involves positioning the steering linkage so that a line drawn through both front wheels intersects the rear axle of the robot.

<img src="./docs/resources/ackermann_steering.png">

While this steering geometry is complex to implement, we believe that the advantages it provides are important, especially in obstacle navigation and parking, where precise control and minimized turning radius are essential. It enables smoother manoeuvring and accurate alignment in narrower spaces.

Our implementation involves designing a custom 3D-printed Ackermann steering mechanism. Using CAD to design the mechanism gives us the flexibility to experiment with pivot points and steering angles. Although true Ackermann geometry is difficult to implement at our robot's scale, we tried to approximate the behavior iteratively by adjusting the servo horns and angles in CAD and prototyping by making smaller changes if it doesn't suit our desired behavior.

**Calibration and Implementation**

To make sure the steering angle performed correctly, we carried out an iterative calibration process:

- We manually adjusted the servo horn angle and linkage positions step by step in FreeCAD until the wheels aligned at the desired steering angle.
- After each adjustment, we observed whether the wheels tracked correctly in both directions.
- Once the optimal angle is reached, we make sure to model the steering mechanism around the angle.

**Reason for Selection:**

- The small size and PWM interface make it easy to control via Raspberry Pi Pico 2.
- It has sufficient torque to steer the front wheels responsively.
- It has balanced speed and stability during turns and lane changes.
- This servo is widely used in hobby robotics, and as such, there is much available documentation and mounting kits.

**Mounting:**

- Screwed directly into a platform plate in front of the chassis into the platform plate.

**Considerations**
While the servo used is adequate for the task, it can still be replaced with something more precise. We plan to upgrade to a high-resolution digital servo with a narrower deadband and metal gears for more accurate movement. By also integrating a PWM driver such as the PCA9685, we gain 12-bit resolution control, which gives the robot the ability to make finer adjustments than the Raspberry Pi’s native PWM.

The power and sensor systems are crucial to the vehicle's ability to navigate the challenges of the competition. For this project, the vehicle is powered by a [EP-0136 Raspberry Pi UPS](https://wiki.52pi.com/index.php?title=EP-0136) (Uninterruptible Power Supply) in our vehicle, with 2x 18650 Lithium-Ion as the energy source. The UPS maintains a stable 5V output to the Raspberry Pi 5 even though there are fluctuations. It also has built-in charging and voltage regulation circuits, allowing continuous operation while also recharging the batteries when external power is connected.
The batteries are connected in series to provide a nominal voltage of 7.4V and a combined capacity of around 4000 mAh, depending on the cells used. This setup is capable of delivering a continuous current of around 20 Amps, which is sufficient to supply to the robot for various tasks. This setup ensures that the Raspberry Pi won't shut down unexpectedly, allowing uninterrupted data processing and decision-making throughout the run.

The motors, however, require a higher voltage — at least 6V, and to ensure reliable performance, the N20 motor power is supplied through a step-up converter that increases 5V to 12V. Because the motor power is separate from the Raspberry Pi, the standard on/off switch could not fully control the system. To solve this, a MOSFET and a 4.4 kΩ resistor were added between the gate and source, with the drain connected to the negative side of the step-up converter. This allows the robot to be safely powered on and off while supplying sufficient power to both the Raspberry Pi and the motors.

The onboard processing unit, the Raspberry Pi 5, serves as the vehicle's brain. Raspberry Pi recommends a 5V 5A power supply. This is well within the limits of what the two batteries can provide.

## 4. Obstacle Management

There are two challenges in this competition:

- The **open challenge** involves the robot completing three full laps around the field without touching the wall. The size of each side of the field and the direction in which the car drives are randomised.
- The **obstacle challenge** requires the robot to complete three laps whilst avoiding the traffic signs. If the sign is red, then the robot must traverse on the right side and if the pillar is green, the robot must traverse on the left. The direction in which the car drives and the placement of the signs are randomised. After the third lap, the car must find the parking area and park in the area without touching the surroundings barriers around it.

Our implementation relies heavily on the RPLIDAR C1 sensor and the fish-eye lens camera for continuous environment scanning, which helps the algorithm decide the movement of the robot.

We divide the strategy into three phases:

- Open Challenge
- Obstacle Challenge
- Parallel Parking Manoeuvre

### 4.1 Open Challenge

![Robot navigating Open Challenge](./docs/resources/lidar_image_open.png)\
*Figure: Example of robot sensing walls and navigating the field.*

The Open Challenge requires the robot to complete three laps around the arena without touching the walls. The driving direction is randomised at the start, so relying on pre-programmed movements is not feasible

The robot determines which direction to turn by analysing the walls detected around it. The algorithm works as follows:

1. **Check for empty walls:**

   - If there are no front walls or no side walls, the function returns `std::nullopt` because it cannot determine a turn direction.

1. **Identify the closest front wall:**

   - Compares all front wall line segments and selects the one with the highest midpoint (largest Y value).
   - Determines the left and right points of this front wall based on their X coordinates.

1. **Evaluate left walls:**

   - Finds the "higher" point of each left wall line segment.
   - Uses `perpendicularDirection` and `perpendicularDistance` to determine if a left turn is feasible.
   - Returns `COUNTER_CLOCKWISE` if a left turn is clear, or `CLOCKWISE` if blocked.

1. **Evaluate right walls:**

   - Similarly, checks the right wall line segments.
   - Returns `CLOCKWISE` if a right turn is clear, or `COUNTER_CLOCKWISE` if blocked.

1. **Fallback:**

   - If no rules match, returns `std::nullopt`, indicating that the turn direction cannot be determined.

*Figure: Example of the robot detecting traffic lights.*

The Obstacle Challenge requires the robot to navigate the arena while avoiding obstacles and detecting traffic lights. The robot combines LiDAR and camera data to make real-time decisions. The main processing steps are:

1. **Determine turn direction**

   - Uses the same algorithm as in the Open Challenge to decide whether to turn CLOCKWISE or COUNTER_CLOCKWISE based on the surrounding walls.
   - If no clear direction is detected, the default is CLOCKWISE.

1. **Convert LiDAR data to Cartesian coordinates**

   - LiDAR points that are too close (< 0.005 m), too far (> 3.2 m), or outside the forward scanning range are ignored.
   - Converts polar coordinates (distance, angle) to Cartesian coordinates relative to the robot.

1. **Filter points based on walls and turn direction**

   - Depending on the current turn direction, left, right, and far walls are used to remove points that are too close to obstacles.
   - Thresholds (`outerEdge = 0.30 m`, `innerEdge = 0.70 m`) define valid regions for candidate traffic lights.

1. **Cluster nearby LiDAR points**

   - Points within `distanceThreshold` (default 0.05 m) are grouped together.
   - Each cluster is averaged to generate a candidate traffic light location.

1. **Filter camera colors**

   - The camera frame is converted to HSV colour space.
   - Thresholded for red, green, and pink colours.
   - The top 50% of the frame is blacked out to reduce noise from the ceiling or irrelevant background.
   - Contours are extracted, and only those larger than the `areaThreshold` are kept.

1. **Combine camera and LiDAR data**

   - For each detected camera block (red/green), find the closest LiDAR point within a maximum allowed horizontal angle difference.
   - Only the nearest point along the ray is matched to prevent duplicate detections.
   - Returns a vector of `TrafficLightInfo` containing both the LiDAR location and the camera block information.

1. **Decision making**

   - Using the combined traffic light data, the robot can identify which traffic light is relevant for its current path.
   - Integrates turn direction, obstacle positions, and traffic light locations to navigate safely and efficiently.

### 5.2 Chassis Design

**Design Overview**

Our chassis was designed with a focus on weight and modularity. The goal is for our chassis to be a stable platform on which we can implement the steering geometry.

**Layout**
The layout of the chassis is made to fit the rear-mounted motors and front-mounted steering mechanism. Meanwhile, electronics and sensors are mounted in the centre for ease of wiring.

Our robot chassis was completely custom-designed and 3D printed using [esun PLA+](https://esun3dstore.com/products/pla-pro), which we found is easy to print with, offering a smoother texture while being lightweight and durable. The chassis was also designed with modularity in mind for additional future components and fixes, with reduced overhangs for printing ease. Apart from the main chassis, the drivetrain and steering modules are mounted on our 3D-printed detachable plates that can be fine-tuned during testing, other components, such as motor clamps, sensor brackets, are designed as independent printable components.

**Notes on structure:**

- **`apps/`**: Executables for tests, challenges, and log visualization (Pi 5-specific).
- **`external/`**: Third-party libraries like LCCV, RPLIDAR SDK, Pico SDK.
- **`scripts/`**: System control scripts (shutdown, battery check, etc.).
- **`src/modules/`**: Hardware-specific functional modules.
- **`src/processors/`**: Data processing pipelines (camera, LIDAR, combined sensors).
- **`src/types/`**: Data structure headers for the local target.
- **`src/utils/`**: Utility classes (PID controllers, logging, ring buffers).
- **`shared/`**: Code reused by both `raspberry-pi-5` and `raspberry-pi-pico-2` (I2C handling, types).
- **`build.sh` & `CMakeLists.txt`**: Build scripts for each hardware target.

This structure allows Pi 5 and Pi Pico to share common code while keeping hardware-specific modules separate.
